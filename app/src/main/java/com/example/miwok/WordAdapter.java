         *    But this involves a lot of duplicate code.

         *    We can hide or show a view in android while the app is running using control flow statements.
         *
         * SOLUTION (To fix PhrasesActivity):
         *  Modify WordAdapter so we use an if/else statement.
         *  If there is an image associated with the Word object, show the ImageView; otherwise hide the ImageView.
         *  In order to determine whether we should hide or show an ImageView in the list item, we can check whether or not a constructor has set an Imageview (in Word.java)
